   <h1>What is Yoga for me ?</h1>
   <p>
        For me, yoga has always been much more about the emotional than the physical.</li> 
       The tension we hold in our hearts is reflected in the body. Asana is a way to see what needs more love and healing on the inside.</li>
     
    This is why I practice: everything I do on the mat is valuable.</li>
         
       Even in the difficult moments — especially in the difficult moments — I'm on a journey that opens my heart. And sometimes my heart cracks open just enough for my body to open up, too.</li>
